# Docker Practice

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that package all the necessary dependencies and libraries needed for an application to run. Docker provides tools and workflows for building, distributing, and running containers efficiently across different environments, enabling developers to streamline the software development lifecycle and improve consistency in deployment.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install the project, including any prerequisites and dependencies. This might involve Docker installation steps and any specific setup required for the project.



```bash
# Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
    cd project

# Build the Docker image
    docker build -t project .

# Run the Docker container
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 project

```

    
## Usage

```javascript
# Start the Docker container
docker start project

# Stop the Docker container
docker stop project

# Access the project via web browser at http://localhost:8080

```




## Configuration

- Environment Variables
```bash
# Set environment variables
    docker run -d -e ENV_VARIABLE=value project

```
- Docker Volumes
```bash
# Create a Docker volume
  docker volume create myvolume

# Run container with volume
  docker run -d -v myvolume:/path/to/mount project


```
- Docker Networks
```bash
# Create a Docker network
  docker network create mynetwork

# Run container on a network
  docker run -d --network mynetwork project

```
- Docker Mounts
```bash
# Mount a host directory into container
  docker run -d -v /host/path:/container/path project

```



## Testing


```bash
# Run tests
  docker exec -it project pytest

```



## Deployment


```bash
# Deploy using Docker Compose
    docker-compose up -d

```
